# Rate My Selfie
A project to demonstrate playgrounds and snapshot testing in a "real" application, the way I'm doing it at Tigerspike. This is the code from a talk at Brisbane App Developers Meetup. 

The app is based on Apple sample code demonstrating the iOS 13 Vision SDK: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/vision/selecting_a_selfie_based_on_capture_quality

Selfie TestData images are taken from Google Images. They will be removed on request. 

## Usage
To use the playgrounds, build the RateMySelfieUI framework for simulator first.

The snapshot tests execute against the RateMySelfieUI target.
